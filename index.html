              <h2>Great Wall of China</h2>
              <pre>
                      The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese:<br />
                万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng, literally "ten thousand li long wall")<br />
                is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern<br />
                borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against<br />
                various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built<br />
                from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined<br />
                by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the<br />
                Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained<br />
                multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were<br />
                built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).</pre>

                <h2>Petra</h2>
                             <pre>
                         Petra Arabic: romanized: Al-Batraʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα, "Rock", Nabataean:<br />
                    , originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō, is a historic and<br />
                     archaeological city in southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah,<br />
                     in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running<br />
                     from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. The area around Petra has been inhabited from as<br />
                     early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital <br />
                    city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC. Archaeological work has only discovered<br />
                     evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC, by which time Petra had <br />
                    become their capital. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to<br />
                     the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.</pre>

                     <h2>Colosseum</h2>
                     <pre>
                              The Colosseum (/ˌkɒləˈsiːəm/ KOL-ə-SEE-əm; Italian: Colosseo [kolosˈsɛːo]) is an elliptical<br />
                        amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is <br />
                       the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre <br />
                       in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD)<br />
                        in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81). Further <br />
                       modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96). The three emperors who were <br />
                       patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the <br />
                       Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro<br />
                        ˈflaːvjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).</pre>

                        <h2>Chichen Itza</h2>
                        <pre>
                                 Chichén Itzá (often spelled Chichen Itza in English and traditional Yucatec Maya) was <br />
                            a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period.<br />
                            The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.<br />
                            Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late<br /> 
                            Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the<br /> 
                            early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude<br />
                             of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and<br /> 
                            Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once<br />
                             thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico,<br /> 
                            but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.</pre>

                            <h2>Machu Picchu</h2>
                            <pre>
                                    Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of<br />
                                southern Peru on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge. Often referred <br />
                               to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire.<br />
                                It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province above the <br />
                               Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River<br />
                                flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.<br />
                               (For most speakers of English or Spanish, the first 'c' in Picchu is silent. <br />
                               In English, the name is pronounced /ˌmɑːtʃuː ˈpiːtʃuː/ or /ˌmætʃuː ˈpiːktʃuː/,<br />
                               in Spanish as [ˈmatʃu ˈpitʃu] or [ˈmatʃu ˈpiɣtʃu], and in Quechua (Machu Pikchu) as [ˈmatʃʊ ˈpɪktʃʊ].)</pre>

                                ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra,<br />
                                Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor,<br />
                                Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal;<br />
                                it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a <br />
                               17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is<br />
                                set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</pre>

                                         Christ The Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese:<br /> 
                                    [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,<br />
                                     created by French sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da <br />
                                    Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor <br />
                                    Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue <br />
                                    is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch <br />
                                    28 metres (92 ft) wide. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.<br />
                                     Christ The Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan<br />
                                     was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project <br />
                                    organisers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide.</pre>
