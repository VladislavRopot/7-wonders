            <div>
                <p>The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese:
                    万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng, literally "ten thousand li long wall")
                    is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern
                    borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against
                    various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built
                    from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined
                    by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the
                    Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained
                    multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were
                    built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).</p>

                    Petra Arabic: romanized: Al-Batraʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα, "Rock", Nabataean:
                    , originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō, is a historic and
                    archaeological city in southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah,
                    in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running
                    from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. The area around Petra has been inhabited from as
                    early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital
                    city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC. Archaeological work has only discovered
                    evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC, by which time Petra had
                    become their capital. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to
                    the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.

                    The Colosseum (/ˌkɒləˈsiːəm/ KOL-ə-SEE-əm; Italian: Colosseo [kolosˈsɛːo]) is an elliptical
                    amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is
                    the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre
                    in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD)
                    in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81). Further
                    modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96). The three emperors who were
                    patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the
                    Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro
                    ˈflaːvjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name
                    (Flavius).

                    Chichén Itzá (often spelled Chichen Itza in English and traditional Yucatec Maya) was
                    a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period.
                    The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.
                    Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late
                    Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into
                    early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude
                    of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and
                    Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once
                    thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico,
                    but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result
                    of cultural diffusion.

                    Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of
                    southern Peru on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge. Often referred
                    to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire.
                    It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province above the
                    Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River
                    flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain
                    climate.
                    (For most speakers of English or Spanish, the first 'c' in Picchu is silent.
                    In English, the name is pronounced /ˌmɑːtʃuː ˈpiːtʃuː/ or /ˌmætʃuː ˈpiːktʃuː/,
                    in Spanish as [ˈmatʃu ˈpitʃu] or [ˈmatʃu ˈpiɣtʃu], and in Quechua (Machu Pikchu) as [ˈmatʃʊ
                    ˈpɪktʃʊ].)

                    The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the Palace') is an
                    ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra,
                    Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor,
                    Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal;
                    it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a
                    17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is
                    set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

                    Christ The Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese:
                    [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
                    created by French sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da
                    Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor
                    Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue
                    is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch
                    28 metres (92 ft) wide. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.
                    Christ The Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan
                    was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project
                    organisers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms
                    spread out wide.
